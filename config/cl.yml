# For files that are imported from the -edit file (imports, components,
# pattern-derived definitions), we cannot point to the latest release
# download folder as we do below in the "generic" fall-through, because
# those files are _not_ release artefacts and are therefore absent from
# that folder. Instead, we point to the current master branch.
